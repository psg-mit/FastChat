For example, if you are using `g++`, you can compile the program with the following command:\n   ```\n   g++ -o WordCount WordCount.cpp\n   ```\n   This will create an executable named `WordCount` in the same directory.\n3. **Run the program**: Still in the terminal or command prompt, you can run the program by typing:\n   ```\n   ./WordCount\n   ```\n   or on Windows,\n   ```\n   WordCount.exe\n   ```\n   Follow the prompts to enter the name of your text file and the word you want to count.\n\n### Note\n- This program performs an exact match case-sensitive search for the word.

The following example demonstrates a simple way to validate an email address. This example checks for a basic structure: a series of characters that may include dots and hyphens, followed by an `@` symbol, then another series of characters which may include dots, and finally a domain suffix. Note that email validation can get quite complex due to the variety of valid formats, so this is a simplified version.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef validate_email(email):\n    # Regular expression for validating an email\n    regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'\n    \n    # Using fullmatch to ensure the entire string matches the pattern\n    if re.fullmatch(regex, email):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nemails = [\"user@example.com\", \"user.name@example.com\", \"user.name+tag@example.co.uk\", \"user.name@example\", \"user@.com\"]\n\nfor email in emails:\n    print(f\"{email}: {validate_email(email)}\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `validate_email` that takes an email address as input and returns `True` if it matches the regular expression, otherwise `False`. The regular expression used here is:\n\n- `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+`: Starts with one or more letters (either uppercase or lowercase), numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens.\n- `@`: Followed by an `@` symbol.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: Followed by one or more letters (either uppercase or lowercase), numbers, dots, or hyphens.\n- `\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`: Ends with a dot followed by two or more letters, which typically represent the domain.\n\nThis is a basic pattern and might not cover all valid email address cases or might falsely validate some incorrect email addresses due to the complexity of the official email address specifications. For more robust validation, you might consider using libraries like `validate_email` or leveraging the validation provided by frameworks or email sending services."]}], "tstamp": 1709929485.439828}

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.\n\nHere's a simple Python program that uses dynamic programming (specifically, a bottom-up approach) to find the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize cache\n    fib_cache = [0] * (n+1)\n    fib_cache[1] = 1\n    \n    # Bottom-up dynamic programming approach\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        fib_cache[i] = fib_cache[i-1] + fib_cache[i-2]\n    \n    return fib_cache[n]\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `fibonacci(n)` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. It initializes a list `fib_cache` to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are computed, which allows the function to access previously computed values efficiently, avoiding the redundant calculations that a naive recursive approach would entail. This makes the dynamic programming solution much more efficient for large values of `n`."]}], "tstamp": 1709929465.5764139}

It uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to keep track of the current subarray it is searching.
